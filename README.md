Hey there!
Welcome to my digital portfolio. I'm a software developer specializing in embedded systems, with a passion for creating impactful and user-friendly solutions.

My work focuses on the intersection of software and hardware, particularly in the automotive industry. I have a strong background in developing UI/UX and GUI systems for automotive infotainment and cluster displays, creating seamless and intuitive experiences for drivers and passengers.

In addition to my work on user interfaces, I have extensive experience with automotive gateways, building robust software that allows different electronic control units (ECUs) to communicate effectively via CAN bus. I also have skills in web development, which I use to create the platforms and tools that support my embedded projects.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover how I bring innovative software solutions to life, from the low-level code that powers a vehicle to the polished user interface on its screen.
